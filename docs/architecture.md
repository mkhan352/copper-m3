# Architecture

How the Copper State Labs app fits together. Each module adds a section at the
end (see [Adding a module](#adding-a-module)) when it changes how the app
works: new pages, tables or AI calls.

_Fictional — for educational use._

## The starter app (Module 0)

A Next.js app that builds, runs and deploys with **no environment variables**.
A Google AI Studio key is optional until a module needs one.

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Pages | `app/` | `layout.tsx` sets the fonts and theme; `page.tsx` is the placeholder home page |
| Brand components | `components/copper/` | `Logo`, `SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`, `ModeToggle` |
| UI kit | `components/ui/` (shadcn), `components/ai-elements/` (AI Elements) | The only UI libraries the app uses |
| Setup card | `components/setup-required.tsx` | `<SetupRequired service="ai" />`, shown instead of a page whose service isn't configured |
| Company catalog | `lib/copper/catalog.ts`, `lib/copper/data/catalog.json` | Product, plan and privacy facts from the Product Bible (Sections 3, 4, 8 and 10). Pages read prices and plan details from here instead of typing them (added in the Module 1 starter) |
| AI wrapper | `lib/ai/call.ts` | `callText` and `callObject`: every model call goes through these and is logged to the terminal |
| Models and prices | `lib/ai/models.ts`, `lib/ai/pricing.ts` | The approved Gemini models and their token prices |

## Data flow

1. A user opens a page in `app/`.
2. Server code checks what's configured (`isAiConfigured()`). If the key is
   missing, the page renders `<SetupRequired />` instead of crashing.
3. Data comes from files under `lib/copper/data/`.
4. AI requests go through `callText` / `callObject` in `lib/ai/call.ts`, which
   calls Google and then prints one `[ai_calls]` line: `module`, `feature`,
   `model`, tokens, `cost_usd`, `latency_ms`, `ok`.

```ts
const { text } = await callText(
  { module: 2, feature: "ask-copper" },
  { prompt },
);
```

## Two kinds of "AI tiers"

Don't mix these up:

- **Copper State Labs' product tiers** (On-device, Raw Ore, Refined, the
  Copper Cloud) are part of the fictional company. They are facts in the
  [Product Bible](copper-state-labs/product-bible.md) and rows in the `ai_tiers`
  table.
- **The models this app calls** are real Claude models listed in
  `lib/ai/models.ts`. Their cost is logged in `ai_calls`.

## Decisions

- **No environment variables required.** Every service is optional, so a fresh
  clone builds and deploys before any accounts are set up.
- **One AI wrapper.** Routing every call through `lib/ai/call.ts` gives one
  place to log cost and latency per module and feature.
- **No authentication or row-level security yet.** They arrive in a later
  module.

## Adding a module

When a module changes how the app fits together, add a section here:

```md
## Module N: <feature name>

**Summary:** one or two sentences: what this adds and why.

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Page / route | `app/...` | |
| Components | `components/...` | |
| Data | `lib/copper/data/...` | Data files added |
| AI calls | `lib/ai/call.ts` (module, feature) | Model, prompt purpose, expected cost per call |

**Data flow:** user action → page → server code → database / model → response.

**Decisions and trade-offs:** what you chose, the alternatives, and why.

**Risks and open questions:** cost, privacy, accuracy or safety risks, and how
you handle them.
```

## Module 3 starter: Ask Copper

**Summary:** Ask Copper, the Module 2 shopping chatbot, finished: a floating
chat panel that answers prices, totals and stock with four tools and shows
each step. Module 3 teaches it to answer from the customer documents.

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Component | `components/copper/ask-copper.tsx` | The launcher and chat panel, mounted from `app/page.tsx` and opened by the header's `#ask` link. Draws each answer as stations: the tools on offer, thinking, each tool call, then the reply |
| Server Action | `lib/copper/assistant/ask.ts` | `askCopper()`: streams the conversation with `callStream`, up to 5 steps, and sends each step back as a live `Progress` |
| Tools | `lib/copper/assistant/tools.ts` | `copperTools`: `get_products`, `get_prices`, `calculate_cost`, `check_availability` |
| Instructions | `lib/copper/assistant/instructions.ts` | `COPPER_INSTRUCTIONS`. Copper says it can't help yet with warranty, setup, troubleshooting or privacy |
| Data | `lib/copper/inventory.ts`, `lib/copper/documents.ts` | Stock from `lib/copper/data/inventory.json`; `DOCUMENTS`: the four customer documents and their PDF paths under `public/docs/`. The PDFs are added in class |
| AI calls | `{ module: 2, feature: "ask-copper" }` | One streamed call per question |

## Module 3: Document passages and embeddings

**Summary:** The four customer PDFs are split into small passages, and each
passage is turned into an embedding (a list of numbers that captures its
meaning). They are saved in one JSON file the app keeps in memory, so a
customer's question can later be matched to the right passages.

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Script | `scripts/build-embeddings.ts` (`npm run embed`) | Reads every PDF in `public/docs/`, makes the passages, embeds them, writes the JSON file. Run it again whenever a PDF changes |
| Chunker | `lib/copper/rag/chunk.ts` | Drops the header and footer lines that repeat on each page, splits pages into sentences, and groups up to 3 sentences (about 700 characters) into a passage. Each passage keeps its document title and page number, and its text starts with the title |
| Data | `lib/copper/data/passages.json` | 99 passages with their embeddings (768 numbers each, scaled to length 1) |
| Loader | `lib/copper/rag/passages.ts` | `PASSAGES`: imports the JSON once when the server starts, so it stays in memory |
| AI calls | `lib/ai/call.ts` `callEmbedMany` / `callEmbed` (`{ module: 3, feature: "embed-documents" }`) | `gemini-embedding-001`, one call for all passages, about $0.15 per million tokens, so a few cents at most. `callEmbed` is for embedding a customer's question later |

**Data flow:** PDFs in `public/docs/` → `npm run embed` → `passages.json` → loaded into memory at startup → (next) a question is embedded and compared with every passage.

**Decisions and trade-offs:** Passages are about 300 characters on average, small enough to be specific and large enough to make sense alone. 768 numbers per passage, not the model's 3072, keeps the file under 1 MB with little loss in quality. Vectors are scaled to length 1 so comparing two is a simple multiply-and-add. Passages are stored with `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` and questions will use `RETRIEVAL_QUERY`, which Gemini is built to match.

**Risks and open questions:** The file goes stale if a PDF changes and `npm run embed` isn't re-run. Sentence splitting is rule-based, so an unusual abbreviation could split a sentence early. Tables and text inside images aren't read.
